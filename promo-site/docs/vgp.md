In pop culture, scientists are often depicted as toiling alone in the lab only to be blindsided by their eureka moment. In reality, scientific progress is typically more collaborative and gradual. More often than not, breakthroughs happen as the result of an interconnected ecosystem of dedicated researchers and experts working across manifold domains. In our current landscape, access to leading-edge technology has become increasingly essential for connecting scientists regardless of research area.  

Jetstream2 continues to be a leader in expanding access to advanced cyberinfrastructure, particularly for research communities without previous high performance computing experience or an easy route to harness the massive computing power that innovation now demands. With access to Jetstream2, researchers make breakthroughs in areas as far-reaching as atmospheric science, biology, chemistry, and media studies.

Sharing a similar ethos, [the Galaxy Project](https://galaxyproject.org/) is a longtime partner of Jetstream2 that provides thousands of researchers who may not have extensive experience with programming or system administration with the tools and training needed for data intensive analysis. As an open-source, web-based platform, Galaxy also emphasizes reproducibility and transparency by allowing users to share their complete analysis, including tools, parameters, and data. 

Supported by Galaxy and Jetstream2, [the Vertebrate Genomes Project](https://vertebrategenomesproject.org/) (VGP) is a powerful example of the impact that this democratized access to flexible high performance computing resources can have on scientific research. In record time, the VGP has been able to produce near error-free, chromosome-level genomes for 600 species by utilizing toolkits on the Galaxy platform specifically tailored for genome assembly and supported by the scalable computing power of Jetstream2. 

When discussing how Jetstream2 fuels the work performed on the Galaxy platform, Professor Anton Nekruntenko, principal investigator of the Galaxy Project and Delphine Larivière an Assistant Professor in the Nekrutenko Lab at Penn State, both highlight the handling of dynamic allocations. This flexibility is crucial for a project like VGP that requires switching between processing massive amounts of data on demand and smaller less compute-heavy jobs. 

As Nekrutenko explains, “it is helpful to recognize that biology is as computationally intensive as physics and engineering now,” further noting that a project like VGP is a primary example of increased demands with its usage of “6 million service units in one month.” 

“An important thing about Jetstream2” Nekrutenko further clarifies, “is the presence of these very large nodes, because some steps in the genome assembly require a lot of memory and a big machine but you cannot run all jobs on that big node, because it is going to be a waste of resources.” Jetstream2’s ability to handle these heterogenous workloads efficiently serves as the perfect “Swiss Army knife” according to Nekruntenko. 

With continued support, VGP’s ultimate goal of generating reproducible reference genomes for the approximately 70,000 known living vertebrate species will have profound impact on researchers and specialists working on evolution and biodiversity. With applications as far-reaching as medicine, agriculture, and wild life conservation, these genomic resources are vital for addressing the fundamental biological questions that shape our world.

“Every single species tells you a different story, actually they tell you many stories, and these stories have relevance for human health and for understanding ecosystems,” explains Giulio Formenti a research assistant professor at Rockwell University and co-director of the Vertebrate Genome Laboratory. 

Expanding the number of model organisms that can be used to understand human features is a fundamental goal of VGP project. Formenti illustrates the potential connections through the example of the zebra finch which has the ability to learn complex songs. As Formenti explains, studying a trait like vocal learning in the genome of a disparate species can open new paths for understanding that similar, but difficult to study, trait in humans. 

 “95% of the main discoveries that have driven biotechnology in the last 70 years came from studying things that were not model organisms at the time, and they were definitely not human—they came from jellyfish or songbirds,” Formenti explains. 

Emphasizing the urgency of the project, Formenti notes the number of endangered species and the risk of losing “a trove of biological information forever if we don’t act now.” 

The interconnectedness and exigency that Formenti notes in our biodynamic world resonates throughout the sciences. Sustained public funding enables partnerships such as the one between Galaxy and Jetstream2 to change the way science is done by helping individual researchers overcome financial barriers to accessing expensive advanced cyberinfrastructure. These collaborations provide projects like VGP a gateway for making discoveries that have ripple effects across science and society.
