# Galaxy promo site: purpose and structure

## Purpose

Create a web site with pages described below. ultrathink about this problem. The web-site will be used to drive a slide shop as a conference booth were we are trying to pitch Galaxy to various profit and non-profit organizations, such as biotech companies, biomedical companies, as well as individual labs and researchers. 

## Overall design principles

The website should contain a series of pages, each of which is described below. The overall theme should be very clean, like Apple does its websites. There should be a possibility to auto-play this site, in other words, that pages switch using some kind of a timer, maybe every 10 seconds or so. This should obviously be configurable. It should use the color scheme of usegalaxy.org, but it can use different fonts that most resemble Apple styles. All slides should be editable as markdown.

## Pages

All pages should have a common masthead with the following items: Global use, Capability, Ecosystem. Each of the pages will correspond to one of the items in this masthead. For example, we will have several pages related to Galaxy, several pages related to training, and several pages related to infrastructure. 

### The following pages should be displayed under masthead item "Global use"

#### Page 1: Galaxy in numbers

Create a beautiful rendering of data from /Users/anton/git/gxy-reports/RS.md section ## 1.1. Galaxy in numbers

#### Page 2: Galaxy is widely used

Use context from section ### 1.3.2. from /Users/anton/git/gxy-reports/RS.md and image 2

#### Page 3: Galaxy is widely cited

Use context from section ### 1.4.1 from /Users/anton/git/gxy-reports/RS.md and image 5

#### Page 4: Galaxy is highly scalable

Use context from section ### 1.4.2. from /Users/anton/git/gxy-reports/RS.md and image 6 and table 4

#### Page 5: Galaxy is a tool ecosystem

Use context from section ### 1.4.3. from /Users/anton/git/gxy-reports/RS.md and table 5

#### Page 6: Galaxy is a global training hub

Use context from section ### 1.4.7. from /Users/anton/git/gxy-reports/RS.md and table 5\8 and image 13

### The following pages should be displayed under masthead item "Capabilities"

#### Page 7: A universe of applications

Make an animated word-cloud (or propose some other striking animated graphics) from topic listed in https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/ under https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/#scientific-fields and https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/#methodologies

#### Page 8: Scalable genome assembly

Create a slide using coxtext from /Users/anton/git/gxy-reports/promo-site/vgp.md and use /Users/anton/git/gxy-reports/promo-site/tree.png as an image

### The following pages should be displayed under masthead item "Ecosystem"

#### Page 9: Global instances

Create a page with screenshots of usegalaxy.org, usegalaxy.eu, and usegalaxy.org.au and write a paragraph describing usegalaxy.* consortium https://galaxyproject.org/usegalaxy/

#### Page 10: Tool ecosystem: IUC

Create a page using context form https://github.com/galaxyproject/tools-iuc

#### Page 11: Workflow ecosystem: IWC

Create a page using a context from https://github.com/galaxyproject/iwc

#### Page 12: Biocontainers

Create a page using a context from https://biocontainers.pro/

#### Page 13: Planemo

Create a page using a context from https://github.com/galaxyproject/planemo

#### Page 14: Pulsar

Create a page using a context from https://github.com/galaxyproject/pulsar

#### Page 15: TPV

Create a page using a context from https://github.com/galaxyproject/total-perspective-vortex 

## Iteration 2

Make the following changes:

### Slide 1

- Make numbers 33% larger
- Use full numbers (e.g,, 2,000,000+ instead of 2M+)
- Change "The most direct indication of community need is the extent of community adoption enjoyed by Galaxy." to "Serving biological researchers worldwide since 2005"

### Slide 2

Skip (remove)

### Slide 4

Use hi-res version of the image from access-map.svg

### Slide 5

Replace "Galaxy gives immediate access to thousands of tools for all major types of data analyses in life sciences." with "Galaxy serves thousands of open source analysis tools and is tightly integrated with BioConda and BioContainer communities"

### Slide 6

Use the following hires image instead: map_number.svg

### Slide 7

Make words from word cloud bigger and make sure they do not obscure the title "A Universe of Applications". Maybe you need to put title in a box with the same color as the background and make work cloud items "pass" underneath it. For word cloud use the same font as the fonts in the site. Can  you make words clickable and poiint to corresponding GTN items?

### Slide 9

Instead of the three boxes use galaxies.svg as a background for this entire page
