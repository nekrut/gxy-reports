# Galaxy promo site: putpose and structure

## Purpose

Create a web site with pages described below. ultrathink about this problem. The web-site will be used to drive a slide shop as a conference booth were we are trying to pitch Galaxy to various profit and non-profit organizations, such as biotech companies, biomedical companies, as well as individual labs and researchers. 

## Overall design principles

The website should contain a series of pages, each of which is described below. The overall theme should be very clean, like Apple does its websites. There should be a possibility to auto-play this site, in other words, that pages switch using some kind of a timer, maybe every 10 seconds or so. This should obviously be configurable. It should use the color scheme of usegalaxy.org, but it can use different fonts that most resemble Apple styles. All slides should be editable as markdown.

## Pages

All pages should have a common masthead with the following items: Global use, Capability, Ecosystem. Each of the pages will correspond to one of the items in this masthead. For example, we will have several pages related to Galaxy, several pages related to training, and several pages related to infrastructure.
